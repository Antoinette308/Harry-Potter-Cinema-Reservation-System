# Harry Potter Movie Marathon API 

## About

I made a Harry Potter Movie Mararthon API üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßπ. Here, a cinema will play the Harry Potter movies in chronological order over 8 consecutive weekends. The first screening begins 19th October 2024 with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and concludes on the 7th December 2024 with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.

## Features 

My API is designed so that users can: 
- View all of the available Harry Potter movies over the 8 weekends 

- Make reservations for Harry Potter movie screenings

- See how many seats are available for specific movie times

### Installation requirements 
- Node.js
- npm
- MySQL 

### Set up Instructions 

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder

2. Install the required dependencies

```
npm install express mysql2 dotenv body-parser
```

- express: for bulding the API 
- mysql2: to interact with MySQL
- dotenv: for loading environment variables
- body-parser: for parsing incoming requests

3. Set up the .env file
- Create a .env file at the root of the project and add your MySQL credentials

```
    DB_HOST=localhost

    DB_USER=root

    DB_PASSWORD=your_password

    DB_NAME=cinema_db
```

4. Start your MySQL and run the SQL scripts to create the cinema_db database and the movies and reservations tables.
